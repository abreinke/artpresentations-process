<h2>Personal Project</h2>
<h3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p><i>Memories</i> is a project which was inspired by a trip I took to the  ruins of the Wat temples, during a vacation to Vietnam.  I remember looking at these ruins and thinking that certain factors- such as war and time- can cause irreversable damage to these sacred, cultural monuments.  I created this piece after this trip and decided to include the cranes, so I could recreate the emotions- such as a longing for the past and the sense of rebirth- which I got from this cultural experience.</p>
