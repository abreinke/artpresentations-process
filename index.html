<div class="desc"><h2><i>Memories</i><div>This is a project which was inspired by a trip I took to the ruins of the Wat temples, during a vacation to Vietnam.  I remember looking at these ruins and thinking that certain factors- such as war and time- can cause irreversable damage to these sacred, cultural monuments.  I created this piece after this trip and decided to include the cranes, so I could recreate the emotions- such as a longing for the past and the sense of rebirth- which I got from this cultural experience.</h2></div>
