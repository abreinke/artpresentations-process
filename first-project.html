<h1><i>Facing Your Fears</i></h1><div>
<p><i>Facing Your Fears</i> is a project which is extremely personal since I created it at a time when many major changes were happening for me; such as the unexpected death of my grandpa and an accident which made my dad temporarily unable to walk.   This project addresses several of my major fears- such as change, loss, and commitment to a project- which I was experiencing during this time.</p>
