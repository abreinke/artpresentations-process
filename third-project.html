<h1><i>Splash</i></h1>
<p><i>Splash</i> is a personal piece which I consider to be captured with a stroke of luck. It was taken a few years ago, during a family trip to the Oregon Coast. My dog, Amber, was enjoying the opportunity to run on the beach and I felt like this was a good time to incorporate motion in my work. After many attempts, I just so happened to get this picture of her and felt that it captured some major things; such as vivid light, water motion patterns, and a silhouetted image of my dog.</p>
