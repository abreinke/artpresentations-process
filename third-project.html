<h1><i>Splash</i></h1>
<p><i>Splash</i> is a personal piece and action shot which I consider a stroke of luck.  It was taken a few years ago, during a family trip to the Oregon Coast. My dog, Amber, was enjoying the opportunity to run on the beach and I felt like this was a good time to get some pictures.  After many failed shots, I just so happened to get this picture of her which perfectly captures many elements; such as vivid light, patterns of spashing water, and a silhouette of my dog.</p>
