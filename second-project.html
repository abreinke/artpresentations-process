<h1><i>Native Plants Assignment</i></h1>
</div>
<p><i>Native Plants Assignment</i> was a project which required my ARTH 193A class to go out in nature and draw ten of California's native plants.  I decided to include these drawings since I feel like they were the best at capturing the plants in their true forms.</p>
