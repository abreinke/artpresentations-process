<h1><i>Native Plants Assignment</i></h1>
</div>
<p><i>Native Plants Assignment</i> was an observational project which required my ARTH 193A class to go out into nature and draw ten of California's native plants.  It was an assignment which challenged me to be dedicated and patient, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and felt that it helped me practice on my drawings of still objects.  There are several other plants which I also drew, but I decided to include these works since I feel like they were the two which best depicted the plantsâ€™ details.</p>
